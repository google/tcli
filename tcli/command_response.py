  """Stores response results and current state for device inventory Callback.

  The command string itself is not handled here. Rather we have a unique ID(uid)
  that corresponds to a command sent. So here we track the number of commands
  sent (row numbers) and the number of hosts the command was issued to. When
  all responses are returned for the current row then a call to GetRow returns
  it.

  Each command sent to the targets ha a corresponding entry here setup by
  SetCommandRow. A command equates to a row, and each target is a column. We
  store any pipe value here as well, as it is not sent to the target and the
  inventory class doesn't handle it.

  Each request objects returned uid is tracked by SetRequest, mapping request
  uid to row ids.

  Responses are collected in 'results' by AddResponse, called asyncronously.

  GetRow is polled and returns the next row of results when it is ready for
  displaying. A row is ready when all responses have been received for that row.

  Attributes:
    done: (obj) Event object, true when GetRow reads beyond end of rows.
